            A quick preface before the long wall of text begins: I am just one guy. I'm not a big
            corporation out to sell your data or misuse your content. If any of that ever changes (I hope it won't),
            I'll be the first to let everyone know. Cordia could never be anything without your support. And your
            cooperation in following all the rules to make sure everything goes smoothly. Which is what all this text is
            going to be about. With that, Da Rules:

        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">10. THIRD PARTY CONTENT</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> 
            This Service contains content and functionality provided by third parties(“Providers”) and links to said Providers. 
            These Providers are not affiliated with Cordia and Cordia has no control over these Providers. 
            Cordia does not claim ownership of any content or functionality provided by the Providers and in turn cannot be held responsible for, including but not limit to, 
            any content, links or changes from the Provider. We supply this content and functionality to ensure the best user experience for you and a 
            good relationship between Cordia and these Providers is key.
            <br><br>
            Certain aspects of the Service, including but not limited to, album art, song metadata (name, artist, audio preview) and song search are made available 
            from Providers. Cordia attributes all ownership of this content to the Provider that this data was supplied by. 
            Without Cordia’s cooperation, these Providers would restrict Cordia’s access to such data. In turn, by using or access any functionality of 
            the Service that contains data from a Provider, you consent that Cordia may share information with said Provider contractually requires 
            Cordia to do so to continue said functionality.
        </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">11. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> 
            I may update or edit this Agreement whenever I see fit. 
            If these changes, based on our view, are significant enough, we shall notify you via the Service or, in some cases, 
            will send you an email to the email address associated with your account. 
            By accessing and using the Service after the changes have taken effect, 
            you thereby agree to and are bound by the updated Agreement. If you choose to disagree with the updated Agreement, 
            you must stop using and accessing our Service immediately. 
        </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">12. CHANGES TO CORDIA</h1>

        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">13. DISCLAIMER OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> 
            YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICE ALONG WITH THE
            OUTPUT DATA IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND
            REPRESENTATIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
            WARRANTIES (1) OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, (2) OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OR
            ACCURACY, (3) OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, (4) OF PERFORMANCE, (5) OF TITLE, (6) THAT THE SERVICE WILL OPERATE IN AN
            ERROR FREE, TIMELY, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED MANNER, IS CURRENT AND UP TO DATE AND ACCURATELY DESCRIBES
            ANYTHING, OR IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, (7) THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS IN THE SERVICE
            WILL BE CORRECTED, (8) THAT THE SERVICE IS COMPATIBLE WITH ANY PARTICULAR HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE PLATFORM, OR
            (9) THAT WE WILL ENFORCE THE TERMS OF SERVICE AGAINST OTHERS TO YOUR SATISFACTION. EFFORTS BY ZENPROSPECT TO
            MODIFY THE SERVICE SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A WAIVER OF THESE LIMITATIONS OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS
            OF SERVICE. Some jurisdictions limit or don’t allow the disclaimer of implied warranties – in those states,
            these warranties will be disclaimed only to fullest extent permitted by law. 
        </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> 
            IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS,
            EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AFFILIATES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, SUBLICENSEES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS,
            INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, AND RELATED PARTIES BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF
            USE, LOSS OF DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
            ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICE, OUTPUT DATA OR WITH THE DELAY OR
            INABILITY TO USE SAME, OR FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY, OR FOR ANY CONTENT, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES OBTAINED
            THROUGH OR VIEWED ON THE SERVICE, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF SAME, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
            TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, REGULATION, COMMON LAW PRECEDENT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE RESPECTIVE PARTY HAS BEEN
            ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM A PARTY’S ENTITY’S NEGLIGENCE OR
            GROSS NEGLIGENCE. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SERVICE
            (EXCLUSIVE OF PAYMENT OR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS) EXCEED THE TOTAL OF THE AMOUNT PAID BY EITHER PARTY TO
            THE OTHER DURING THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS. ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS BY ZENPROSPECT MAY APPEAR WITHIN THE SERVICE
            AND ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DISCLAIMERS PLACE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON
            YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE MATERIAL CONTAINED THEREIN, SUCH GREATER RESTRICTIONS SHALL APPLY. Some
            jurisdictions restrict or do not allow the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the
            contents of this section may not apply to you. In cases where such laws apply, the liability of Cordia shall
            be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.
