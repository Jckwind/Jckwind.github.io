        <p class="TOS-Preface"> A quick preface before the long wall of text begins: I am just one guy. I'm not a big
            corporation out to sell your data or misuse your content. If any of that ever changes (I hope it won't),
            I'll be the first to let everyone know. Cordia could never be anything without your support. And your
            cooperation in following all the rules to make sure everything goes smoothly. Which is what all this text is
            going to be about. With that, Da Rules: </p>
        <hr class="divider divider-TOS">
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> Welcome to the Cordia Terms of Service Agreement (the “Agreement”). Please

            website, information, tools, functionality, updates and similar materials (collectively, the "Service")

        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited and
            revocable license to use the Service in accordance with this Agreement. All rights and privileges not
            granted by this Agreement are retained by cordia <br><br>

            Future updates or increased functionality will be therein subject to these
            terms, and may warrant this Agreement to be amended to reflect these changes. <br><br> 
            
            I reserve all rights to update, change, amend or otherwise change one or more of our Services in any manner I decide without
            prior notice. I also reserve the complete right to modify, suspend or completely terminate the Service, at
            our discretion. <br><br> 
            
            You are explicitly forbidden from using any aspects of the Service, including but
            not limited to, the Cordia name, brand images or other such assets related to the Service. These are
            protected by copyright and violation of this rule may warrant legal action against the offending party. </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">3. YOUR CORDIA ACCOUNT</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> You will need to create an account with us to access and use most of the
            Service. To make an account with us, you will have to provide us with information such as your email, a
            username and a strong password. Cordia is not responsible for the security of your account, so ensure this
            password is secure and unique. Failure to do so may cause damage or loss, which Cordia will not liable for. <br><br> 
            
            At times, Cordia may choose to communicate via the email associated with your account regarding
            security issues or administrative announcements. You may not opt out of this messages. Don’t worry, these
            will not be a common occurrence. </p>

        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> This Service contains content and functionality provided by third
            parties(“Providers”) and links to said Providers. These Providers are not affiliated with Cordia and Cordia
            has no control over these Providers. Cordia does not claim ownership of any content or functionality
            provided by the Providers and in turn cannot be held responsible for, including but not limit to, any
            content, links or changes from the Provider. We supply this content and functionality to ensure the best
            user experience for you and a good relationship between Cordia and these Providers is key. <br><br> 
            
            Certain aspects of the Service, including but not limited to, album art, song metadata (name, artist, audio preview)
            and song search are made available from Providers. Cordia attributes all ownership of this content to the
            Provider that this data was supplied by. Without Cordia’s cooperation, these Providers would restrict
            Cordia’s access to such data. In turn, by using or access any functionality of the Service that contains
            data from a Provider, you consent that Cordia may share information with said Provider contractually
            requires Cordia to do so to continue said functionality. </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">10. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> I may update or edit this Agreement whenever I see fit. We shall notify you
            via the Service or, in some cases, will send you an email to the email address associated with your account.
            <br><br> 
            
            By accessing and using the Service after the changes have taken effect, you thereby agree to and
            are bound by the updated Agreement. If you do not agree with the Agreement or any changes made to such
            Agreement, you must stop using and accessing our Service immediately. </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">11. CHANGES TO THE SERVICE</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> I reserve all rights to update, change, amend or otherwise change one or
            more of our Service in any manner I decide without prior notice. </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">12. DISCLAIMER OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICE ALONG WITH THE
            OUTPUT DATA IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND
            REPRESENTATIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
            WARRANTIES (1) OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, (2) OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OR
            ACCURACY, (3) OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, (4) OF PERFORMANCE, (5) OF TITLE, (6) THAT THE SERVICE WILL OPERATE IN AN
            ERROR FREE, TIMELY, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED MANNER, IS CURRENT AND UP TO DATE AND ACCURATELY DESCRIBES
            ANYTHING, OR IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, (7) THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS IN THE SERVICE
            WILL BE CORRECTED, (8) THAT THE SERVICE IS COMPATIBLE WITH ANY PARTICULAR HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE PLATFORM, OR
            (9) THAT WE WILL ENFORCE THE TERMS OF SERVICE AGAINST OTHERS TO YOUR SATISFACTION. EFFORTS BY ZENPROSPECT TO
            MODIFY THE SERVICE SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A WAIVER OF THESE LIMITATIONS OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS
            OF SERVICE. Some jurisdictions limit or don’t allow the disclaimer of implied warranties – in those states,
            these warranties will be disclaimed only to fullest extent permitted by law. </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS,
            EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AFFILIATES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, SUBLICENSEES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS,
            INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, AND RELATED PARTIES BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF
            USE, LOSS OF DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
            ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICE, OUTPUT DATA OR WITH THE DELAY OR
            INABILITY TO USE SAME, OR FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY, OR FOR ANY CONTENT, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES OBTAINED
            THROUGH OR VIEWED ON THE SERVICE, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF SAME, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
            TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, REGULATION, COMMON LAW PRECEDENT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE RESPECTIVE PARTY HAS BEEN
            ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM A PARTY’S ENTITY’S NEGLIGENCE OR
            GROSS NEGLIGENCE. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SERVICE
            (EXCLUSIVE OF PAYMENT OR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS) EXCEED THE TOTAL OF THE AMOUNT PAID BY EITHER PARTY TO
            THE OTHER DURING THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS. ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS BY ZENPROSPECT MAY APPEAR WITHIN THE SERVICE
            AND ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DISCLAIMERS PLACE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON
            YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE MATERIAL CONTAINED THEREIN, SUCH GREATER RESTRICTIONS SHALL APPLY. Some
            jurisdictions restrict or do not allow the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the
            contents of this section may not apply to you. In cases where such laws apply, the liability of Cordia shall
            be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">14. TERMINATION</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> If at any time you would like to end this Agreement, you may do so by simply
            deactivating your account. This action is irreversible and all of your data and content will be permanently
            deleted from the Service. <br><br> 
            
            At our discretion, Cordia may alter, suspend, or terminate your account
            and therefore your ability to access or use the Service. Possible reasons for such action may include, but
            are not limited to: we believe you have violated this Agreement, </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">15. COMMUNICATIONS</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> You hereby give your consent to receive - including, but not limited to -
            emails and announcements from the Service (“Communications”). You also agree that these Communications,
            notices, agreements and disclosure provided electronically meet any legal requirement that such
            communications be in writing. <br><br> 
            
            Cordia is free to use any feedback, review or suggestion you provide
            to Cordia. This information will be ours to use as we see fit and without obligation to you. </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">16. OTHER</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> This Agreement establishes a legal agreement between you and Cordia, stating
            that you will comply with the terms laid out in this Agreement. If any of the clauses or sections within
            this agreement are found to be invalid, illegal or otherwise cannot apply, then it will be amended or
            eliminated from this Agreement. Under such circumstances, the remaining portion of this Agreement shall
            remain in effect. Cordia’s failure to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a
            waiver of such right or provision. </p>
        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">CLOSING</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> If you’ve read the entire agreement, bravo. I’m not going to lie, it sucked
            writing that. And I’m sure it sucked reading it as well. As a reward, you can recieve a hidden profile
            badge. I’ve hidden the instructions in section 6: What you own. Keep this a secret. <br><br> 
            
            When it boils down to it, at least while I write this, I’m at a one man show. I’m a college student, developing the app,
            making the website, learning a bunch of legal jargon to write these Terms. I’m dedicated to being the “Good
            Guy”. I’ve written these terms just as a requirement, I’m not protecting myself for when I inevitably screw
            my users over. My plan is to be as transparent as possible with you, and for you to not sue Cordia lol. I
            hope you enjoy, and that you’ve read this entire section ;) </p>
