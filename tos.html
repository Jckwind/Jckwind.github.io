        <p class="TOS-Preface"> A quick preface before the long wall of text begins: I am just one guy. I'm not a big
            corporation out to sell your data or misuse your content. If any of that ever changes (I hope it won't),
            I'll be the first to let everyone know. Cordia could never be anything without your support. And your
            cooperation in following all the rules to make sure everything goes smoothly. Which is what all this text is
            going to be about. With that, Da Rules: </p>

        <h1 class="TOS-User-Agreement-Header">6. CONNECTED ACCOUNTS</h1>
        <p class="TOS-User-Agreement-Body"> 
            A portion of Cordia will allow you to connect an Account Provider. This is provided to improve your experience. To connect your account, Cordia will request permissions from the Account Provider, and if approved will use safe and secure authentication services to communicate with the Account Provider. The external account will return a unique user token, a refresh token, the date this token expires and other insignificant data.
                <strong>Cordia will not view, store or share your login information.</strong>
                Cordia not directly even handle your login information, your Account Provider provides the unique OAuth ID. The unique ID token is then securely stored and used in app to access only the content which you authorized it to access. We securely store this token for reuse.  
                <br><br>
                Cordia never directly accesses your Third-Party account: it uses tools provided by the Account Providers to make requests on your behalf. An example, but not the only use, would be displaying your recently played songs while creating a post. Cordia will never access, view, modify or use your connected account without your approval or request.
                <br><br>
                To remove and disconnect your connected account, simply remove your connected account using functionality provided by the Service, and the data provided by your Account Provider will be erased. 
                <br><br>
                While we and our Account Providers have worked hard to ensure your connected account will be completely safe, Cordia does not guarantee complete safety and is not liable for any actions that should affect your account, your data or an Account Provider. Furthermore, Cordia entities are not legally related, responsible or liable for any of the Account Providers websites, products, or services. 
                <br><br>
                You connect your Third-Party account at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such third-party account.
